Hey there! I am **Nilesh Parab**, welcome to my blog. I hope my writing would have helped you. If you really like, please do explore my other articles. And yes, do write to me if you feel anything can be done better or you need help with.

Little about me now, I am a **Computer Science** Graduate from **Mumbai University**, Maharashtra, India. And have been working **since 2010 into eCommerce** for most part of it.

I love creating & building things that serve & help people. I believe there is a **feel-good** factor when your code goes live & people around the globe use it, find it great or find it cumbersome.

I feel more at home when once I get my hands dirty with code. So far I have been able to explore few languages, handful of frameworks, products & technologies.

## Languages
* Java
* JavaScript
* Python (bits & pieces)

## Products
* Oracle Commerce (ATG)
* SAP Hybris
* Endeca Forge

## Frameworks
* Gatsby
* Next
* React
* Redux
* Meteor
* Node
* Spring
* Spring Boot

## Databases
* Oracle Database
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* MongoDB

## Platforms
* Heroku
* Netlify
* AWS EC2
* Docker
* Kubernetes

I am also fascinated by **Microservices & Headless Architecture**, that gives you control of every aspect applications.


Apart from this, I love listening to music, it may sound like bragging but I listen to a vivid genres from 70s Rock to Progressive Metal & also some of Bollywood Pop (Spotify recommendations are awesome :heart:).

The next that really fascinates me is Motorcycling, the sheer thrill & joy of riding through rains.

Thanks for reading :beer:
